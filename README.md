# Food-Delivery-Cost-and-Profitability-Analysis
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that analyzes food delivery costs and profitability. The project explores various factors affecting cost structures, revenue generation, and potential business insights for food delivery services.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Food delivery businesses operate in a competitive landscape where profitability depends on multiple factors such as delivery charges, operational expenses, and customer demand. This analysis aims to:

- Identify key cost drivers in food delivery services.
- Evaluate revenue and profitability margins.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on food delivery-related data.
- Use data-driven insights to optimize costs and maximize profits.

## ðŸ“‚ Files in the Repository

- `Food_Delivery_Cost_and_Profitability_.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis and visualizations.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
- `food_orders_new_delhi.csv`: Contains dataset files used in the analysis.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
